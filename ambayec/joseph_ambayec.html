        <p>The Stanley Parable is a game of confusion and funny narration. It has a deep story and captivates its players with its multiple endings. 
          The Stanley Parable has many secrets that only dedicated players will find. The funny narration and the many endings allows for ours of gameplay.
          Originally a mod for Half-Life 2, it was released in 2011. In 2013 it was granted a full remake/game. I appreciate the quirkiness of the narration.
          Your actions have a lot of meaning in this game, for instance if you do not listen to the narrator, he breaks the 4th wall. I have to say, for someone
          who plays more action packed games, this game will seem boring. This game is for the type of people who like story-driven games like the Half-Life series
          and Portal series. It also has a similar art-style to these 2 game series.
