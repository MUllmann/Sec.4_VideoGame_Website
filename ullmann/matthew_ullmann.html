        <h4> Rating 9/10 </h4>
        <p>This game deserves a 9 out of 10 because it contains a great story 
          along with amazing gameplay. What really blows this game out of the 
          water is its stunning visuals.Things that make the game even better is its 
          amusing multiplayer. What dosen't make this game a perfect 10/10 is its 
          bloated third act which is when the content becomes a little repetitve from
          its previous 3 games.</p>
